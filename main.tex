\section{OpenToonz}

\textbf{License approved by OSI or FSF?}\\
\textit Yes, has a new BSD approved by OSI.\newline

\textbf{Which type of license it is (short, long, permissive, copyleft, ...)?}\\ 
\textit{The license has copyright protections: Each contributor holds copyright over their respective contributions.}\newline

\textbf{Use the GitHub forum page (https://github.com/opentoonz/opentoonz) for the following questions and details:}
\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$ How to ask questions about using the project?]\newline
\text{The github homepage has instructions hyperlinked in many tabs such as 'Issues' and the contributing.md file.}\\
   
\item[$\bullet$ How to get latest source code?]\newline
\text{"The project versioning (Git) records all such contribution source information." - Taken from the 'License.txt file.}\\
     
\item{$\bullet$ How to report bugs and request new features in the project?}\\
\text{Through the 'issues' page, opentoonz explains how to report bugs on github and how to best articulate the issue to the developers.}\\
   
\item[$\bullet$ Where to view the code online?]\\
\text{Code can be viewed on the opentoonz github page under the 'code' tab.}\\
    
\item[$\bullet$ Who provides commercial support?]\\
\text{According to the Opentoonz website it reads there is a google group to post questions and the github page to use as support - however it is not clear if there are dedicated support developers. Searching through the 'bug reports', some of the answers are written like they are the developers.}
  
\item[$\bullet$ Where to get information about contributing to the project or if project is active]\\
\text{The project appears to be active as there are people replying to reported bugs in opentoonz via the github page. However the home page does not have an update earlier than one year ago. The contributing.md file on their git homepage explains how to contribute - all of which appears to be through github.}\\
